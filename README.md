# MalFinder™

MalFinder™ is a bot that has the ability to automatically scan the given links and files for malware using VirusTotal, making it easy and simple.

## Getting Started

This bot uses VirusTotal's API to scan your links or files automatically inside Discord. You heard it right! No longer do you need to leave Discord. Just provide the link or file, and you'll get the scanned results right away.

### Installing (if you want to host this bot for your own)
Other than that, there's no need to use this part.

```bash
Git clone this repo
pip install discord.py
Python filename.py
```

## Running the Tests

Simply give a link or file to the bot, and it will scan the files for malware and provide the scan results.

### Sample Tests

If you're worried about downloading a file, this bot can help you!
