# MalFinder™

MalFinder™ is a bot that has the ability to automatically scan the given links and files for malware using VirusTotal, making it easy and simple.

## Getting Started

This bot uses VirusTotal's API to scan your links or files automatically inside Discord. You heard it right! No longer do you need to leave Discord. Just send a link or file anywhere the bot can read messages and it'll start getting the scanned results to you right away.

### Installing

You will need to host the bot as we do not provide hosting as of now.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MilitaryLotus30/MalFinderTM
pip install discord.py
python3 main.py
```

## Running the Tests

Simply send a link or file in any of the chats and it will scan the files or website for malware and provide the scan results with the VirusTotal scan results link.

### Sample Tests

If you're worried about downloading a file, this bot can help you!
